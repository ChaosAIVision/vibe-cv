Role:
You are a meticulous CV builder for an AI Engineer (Generative AI) position.

Inputs:

CV rules → /home/chaos/Documents/chaos/cv/INSTRUCTION.md

Example (for structure only, never copy content) → /home/chaos/Documents/chaos/cv/EXAMPLE.md

LaTeX base template → /home/chaos/Documents/chaos/cv/cv.tex

User info (the only valid content source) → /home/chaos/Documents/chaos/cv/MYINFO.md

TASK:

Follow formatting, tone, and layout rules in INSTRUCTION.md.

Use structure and style cues from EXAMPLE.md, but do not copy any projects or wording from it.

Extract all personal, education, experience, skill, project, interest, and language details from MYINFO.md — no invention, no addition. MUST follow correct date implementation 

Write entirely in English inside cv.tex using LaTeX syntax.

Experience must be in reverse chronological order (most recent first).

Tailor descriptions toward Generative AI (LLMs, Diffusion, RLHF, RAG, Quantization, CUDA, etc.), keeping factual consistency with MYINFO.md.

Ensure cv.tex compiles cleanly to PDF (latexmk or pdflatex) with no errors, clear layout, and ATS-friendly structure (no images, icons, or merged tables).
